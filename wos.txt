AB Mobile Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy) is the teaching practice that emphasizes
   self-determined learning and student autonomy. Many teachers and
   academicians have applied M-Heutagogy in their teaching and learning in
   Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The purpose of this study is to
   synthesize an empirical literature review of the M-Heutagogical practice
   among Higher Education students and its acceptance. The main objective
   of this paper is to review the literature on M-Heutagogy practice and
   its acceptance among Higher Education students. The researcher conducted
   a systematic review of 60 articles for the period 2007 to 2020. The
   findings indicate that M-Heutagogy has been applied in HEIs around the
   world with the support of emergent technologies and mobile applications.
   Unfortunately, only two M-Heutagogy acceptance studies have been done so
   far. Future research suggested that the M-Heutagogy acceptance model
   should be developed to be referred by researchers while doing an
   acceptance study.

AB University lecturers are usually experts within a specific context
   domain of knowledge, however they are seldom expert teachers or
   educational technology wizards. Facilitating professional development
   for lecturers to engage with innovation in teaching and learning
   utilizing new technologies is no simple process. However, we have found
   that structuring lecturer professional development around a sustained
   community of practice can result in a journey of conceptual and
   pedagogical transformation [1]. The increasing ubiquity of mobile
   devices and social media provides a platform for enabling pedagogical
   change. Thus we established a MOBile Community Of Practice (MOBCOP) of
   lecturers interested in researching the potential of mobile social media
   in education interested in exploring the concept of the
   pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum [2], and how mobile learning can
   be utilized as a catalyst [3] to move towards student-directed
   heutagogy. We argue that the MOPCOP framework is potentially applicable
   to a variety of higher education contexts.

AB With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been
   forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required
   students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition,
   teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the
   workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing
   both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning.
   This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and
   the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper
   presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme
   leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated
   heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results
   reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg,
   difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted,
   students preferred learning in a self-determined way.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic?
   Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and
   there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing
   these skills.
   The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online
   space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners.
   Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning
   theory for online learning.
   What this paper adds
   Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings
   in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning
   skills.
   Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an
   instructional strategy.
   Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   implemented self-determined learning.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for
   developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills.
   This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce
   self-determined learning into classroom settings.

AB Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in
   instruction; however, these foundations have not kept pace with
   technology's evolution. Through the use of Information Communication
   Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external
   audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences
   are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and
   exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence
   of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to
   external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive
   pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences
   wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of
   heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for
   assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic
   audiences. Finally, the authors offer an approach for the assessment of
   these assignments, including a rubric.

AB Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce
   has become an overriding objective within higher education. New
   pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and
   support personalization of learning, are central to this objective.
   Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as
   they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for
   lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning
   theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining
   what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of
   learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and
   metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology
   can be a powerful instructional approach for building students'
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this
   is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio
   spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both
   formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses
   critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner's
   acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the
   literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the
   pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in
   online learning environments, and the use of the eportfolio in further
   cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also
   offers recommendations for future practice and theory.

   various way in upgrading and reskilling themselves towards providing
   practical teaching session. Therefore, heutagogical approaches are
   appropriate for improving skill and knowledge among them. This study is
   aimed to determine the efforts level of educator in 13 different
   Vocational colleges in Johor. A total of 141 educators participated in
   the survey questionnaire that measures their efforts toward six
   heutagogical elements in teaching and learning. The finding shows that
   majority of the educators shows the high level of efforts toward
   improving their skills and knowledge. The educator's perception on the
   implementation of heutagogy in teaching and learning process benefit
   tremendously in designing practical and sustainable professional
   development course for educators. Also contributes to heutagogy model in

AB Can a new instructional approach influence lifelong learning and the
   development of competent lifelong learners? Blended and online learning
   provides a platform for learning that introduces technological
   affordance to enable learning. We seek to find an intersection between
   blended and online learning and lifelong learning through an
   instructional approach that encourages learners towards management of
   their own learning. This opens the door to becoming an autonomous,
   capable, self-directed lifelong learner. In this context, heutagogy
   offers an instructional approach that may connect blended and online
   learning settings with the development of lifelong learning competence.
   After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms
   heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning,
   literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency
   capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert
   review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online
   and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical
   experiences exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Results
   corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are
   intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to
   both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic
   Recent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do,
   including the design and delivery of education.
   This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate
   learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the
   lifespan.
   The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the
   opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning
   self-direction, -determination, and -regulation, which can be helpful,
   even essential, for lifelong learning.
   What this paper adds
   This paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that
   heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for
   online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and
   institutional leadership and infrastructure.
   It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could
   contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to
   technology-enabled lifelong learning.
   Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated
   assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development,
   and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be
   considered heutagogical.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   Develop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that
   embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster
   greater self-directed and lifelong learning.
   Educational development to support instructors to understand heutagogy
   and how it can be applied in the design and delivery of blended and
   online learning to foster technology enabled lifelong learning.
   With the implementation of a heutagogical approach, student orientation
   along with purposeful scaffolding needs to be implemented to support
   students as they become more autonomous learners in technology-enabled
   settings.

AB Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of
   conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of
   academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by
   academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if
   we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in
   the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology
   have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn,
   and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from
   universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the
   future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has
   attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control
   over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst
   academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12
   academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their
   views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the
   concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little
   epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are
   going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development
   should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in
   their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics'
   positioning through a typology of epistemic views.

AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the factors that
   influence a learner's ability to be self-directed (Andragogy) and
   self-determined (Heutagogy) may influence the understanding and
   modelling of mobile learning adoption. Heutagogy is seen as a
   progression along a continuum of pedagogical approaches from pedagogy to
   andragogy to heutagogy, where learners need to progress from each with
   the aim of becoming highly autonomous and mature learners. Due to the
   nature of mobile technology, learning can be orientated towards the
   learner to support their needs. Learners are now better equipped to
   manage and control their own learning as learning can take place
   anywhere and anytime. However not all students possess the required
   traits, such as self-management, self-control and desire for learning,
   that signal that are ready for learning that is no longer teacher-lead
   and directed.
   The study examines the results of a survey (n = 446 students) assessing
   how the traits that indicate a readiness for learning that is
   self-directed and self-determined, can impact on students' perceptions
   and adoption of mobile learning. This model was tested using structural
   equation modelling. The findings showed that there was a strong
   association with the factors of self-management, self-control and desire
   for learning on the positive perception of mobile learning and adoption.
   The study reinforces the need for scaffolding and developing learners so
   that they are comfortable to succeed in an environment that is
   self-directed and determined.

AB Higher teacher education in European countries has undergone a
   remarkable transformation due to the constant convergence of educational
   systems and institutions of higher education in Western Europe. The aim
   of the article is to analyze the experience of using innovative
   technologies in higher pedagogical education in the European Union
   countries. Methods of analysis and synthesis, prediction, comparison,
   and abstraction were used to realize this main task. The results traced
   the main innovative technologies popular in European pedagogical
   universities. The effectiveness of interactive learning, modular
   education system, technology of level differentiation, methods of
   learning through research (use of the project method), E-learning, and
   deep use of digital platforms, which contributes to the formation of
   theoretical and practical knowledge, development of critical thinking
   and creative potential in higher education applicants is demonstrated.
   It is pointed out that e-learning based on university platforms allows
   users to actively participate in various international educational
   projects, creatively interact with other users and even create new
   content. Several European universities (from France, Germany, Austria,
   and other countries) have merged their e-learning platforms into one
   professional global service called web2.0. Important directions for the
   further development of teacher education will be heutagogy, peeragogy,
   or paragogy and cybergogy. The conclusions stressed the importance of

AB Since the earliest adoption of educational technologies, teachers and
   researchers have been exploring its efficacy on language learning and
   development. The speed with which these technologies are now
   infiltrating academic student support will continue to increase, and so
   the need for good guidance in this space will likewise increase.
   Currently in academic language and learning support, however, the
   digital space while prevalent and expanding is both poorly defined and
   the literature widely dispersed. It is argued here that a single term of
   reference, such as TALS, could provide a centralised meeting point where
   research and experiences from the field can be more readily and
   conveniently shared.

   A number of studies have explored the opportunities, issues and barriers
   to the use of OERs (Online Learning Task Force, 2011, McGill et al,
   2013, Mtebe and Raisamo, 2014). In addition Massive Online Open Courses
   (MOOC) and their potential as disruptive technologies (Yuan and Powell,
   2013) within the education sector, enable one to explore additional
   dilemmas such as sustainability, quality and commercial viability.
   Each identifies an on-going paradox for academic faculty surrounded by
   these socially oriented web technologies: individuals (and institutions)
   must engage, but may not have the time, finance, or a rewards system to
   merit such commitment.
   The increasing demands for education globally enable the proposed study
   to offer a valuable insight on current and future practice.

   ChatGPT, into higher education, specifically within the field of medical
   education. The focus is on exploring ChatGPT's applications in
   personalized learning, assessment, and content creation while also
   addressing the management of its limitations and ethical considerations.
   Furthermore, we explore the use of ChatGPT as a medical instructor in a
   medical classroom context. We seek to elucidate responses to a preset of
   questions in two categories separated based on targeted remediation,
   pedagogical knowledge, teacher ethics, query detail, practicality, and
   communication pattern. These responses are analyzed based on two rubrics
   designed on the basics of pedagogical prerequisites, and findings are
   reached with a thorough comparative analysis. We hope that this research
   will improve the effective implementation of ChatGPT as a tool for
   enhancing learning and skill development while maintaining ethical

AB The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream
   of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and
   teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are
   constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to
   make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many
   disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can
   we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to
   challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our
   examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they
   positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and
   learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this
   positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice.
   We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to
   higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative
   weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering
   uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this
   offers opportunities for 'teachable moments' (Newell et al, 2023) and
   gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI
   informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher
   education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would
   appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they
   needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy,
   andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that
   people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them,
   and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence.
   Practitioner Notes1. For AI research to contribute to the literature, it
   needs to be informed by it.2. Scholars need to ensure that pedagogy,
   andragogy, and heutagogy come before artificial intelligence.3. People

AB This theoretical article presents the foundational aspects of a
   conceptual, role-playing learning design intended for use in Higher
   Education Schools of computer science and information technology. The
   learning design intends to improve learning ecosystems, bolster student
   engagement and afford learners and educators the benefit of choice and
   amplified autonomy. Second-year students at North-West University (South
   Africa) will be the first cohort to experience the application of the
   newly-designed basic literacy framework which informs the broader
   role-playing learning design exhibited here. The Web literacy framework
   put forward by Mozilla in 2018 to teach critical online proficiencies
   serves as the inspiration for the framework; informing the overall
   role-playing learning design at various levels. Depth of Knowledge
   indicators are mapped onto the Mozilla framework to deepen its
   applicability to tertiary education contexts. Elements of gamification,
   furthermore, are imbedded into the learning design to engage students
   with the self-directed learning aspects of the concept itself, i.e. to
   participate in authentic learning experiences as put forward by
   heutagogical instructional strategies. The role-playing learning design
   makes three roles available to learners, namely: Business Analyst
   (Read), Web Developer (Write) and Customer Service Representative
   (Engage). These roles are tied directly to the three basic literacy
   skill areas iterated upon in the basic literacy framework discussed
   here. Moreover, this article represents part one in a series of articles
   exploring the efficacy and potential of this approach to better serve
   our student cohorts and expand educational offerings. Proceeding papers

AB Integrating advanced technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and
   Augmented Reality (AR) in educational settings can significantly enhance
   learning, especially in vocational education, where practical
   application is crucial. However, understanding the factors influencing
   student acceptance of these technologies remains challenging. This study
   examines how Heutagogical and Cybergogical Behaviors affect vocational
   high school students' intentions to use AR and VR in classrooms, with
   Virtual Experience as a mediator. By extending the UTAUT2 model, the
   research offers insights into technology adoption in vocational
   education. Conducted in July 2024 with 438 students from six Indonesian
   regencies, the study used a quantitative, non-experimental design.
   PLS-SEM analysis revealed that Heutagogical and Cybergogical activities
   significantly influenced students' performance and effort expectancy,
   increasing their intention to use AR and VR. Virtual Experience fully
   mediated the effects of performance expectancy, hedonic motivation,
   social influence, and price value on students' intentions. However,
   effort expectancy and facilitating conditions directly impacted
   behavioral intentions, underscoring the importance of ease of use and
   support in adopting these technologies. The findings suggest that
   integrating structured and self-directed learning approaches, providing
   immersive hands-on opportunities with AR/VR tools, and ensuring ease of
   use and strong institutional support can enhance technology adoption.
   These strategies align vocational training with industry demands,
   preparing students for technologically driven workplaces.

AB Aim/Purpose This study of affordances in educational technology focuses
   on how the selfperceptions of teachers influence the creation of
   educational opportunities and how these are received by learners.
   Background It is important to explore the affordances offered by
   teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of
   their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational
   technology affordances with the two agents-teachers and students-has
   often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational
   interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional
   possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can
   create opportunities to address their students' needs, while effectively
   conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely
   to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration
   are utilised.
   Methodology A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The
   questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult
   students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The
   questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures
   such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation.
   Contribution The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it
   demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning
   have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both
   affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further,
   teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for
   online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social
   involvement from the learner.
   Findings The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed
   learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching
   possibilities for learning interactions.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers are encouraged to vary
   approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as
   enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that
   students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and
   capabilities to engage in social interactions.
   Impact on Society
   This study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending
   the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond
   the boundary of the classroom.
   Future Research Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both
   teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created
   opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants
   further investigation.

AB For transformation to occur in learning environments and for learners,
   higher education must first consider how such transformation will occur
   for the designers and facilitators of learning experiences: the
   university teachers or educators we call faculty (in the US),
   instructors, lecturers or professors or, in some instances, university
   staff. For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as
   educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development
   as educational development or faculty development (more historically
   common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future
   that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that
   crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity,
   social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting
   educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach,
   while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire
   this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide
   springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale
   and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in
   institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories
   of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning,
   connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity.We share
   models of alternative approaches to educator development that take
   advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as #DigPINS,
   Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs.
   We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors')
   daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models
   we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve
   educator professional development that is more transformative,
   participatory, and equitable.

   to draw out critical implications for mlearning project design and
   implementation to avoid common pitfalls leading to potential project
   failure. This article uses the researcher's six critical success factors

AB The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies
   citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services
   associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative
   literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to
   create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual
   environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that
   focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological
   world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical
   principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which
   emphasize the use of technology, self -determined learning, and
   collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the
   participation of 124 Mexican students of technical -professional
   education. The study's objective was to analyze how they scaled their
   communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative
   experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in
   digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico.
   Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic
   thinking (z = -2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly
   higher mean ( M = 25.36) than men ( M = 25.11). Qualitative results
   support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as
   participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This
   suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance
   communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be
   spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital
   literacy.

AB As blended learning (BL) is becoming a new normal in the context of
   higher education, there is a growing need to attune pedagogies to this
   context. As reflective blogs were found to be supportive of pre-service
   student teachers' (PSTs') as well as teacher educators' (TEs')
   professional development, the current study aimed to explore PSTs' and
   TEs' perceptions regarding the potential of integrating blogs into the
   BL modality. Applying a qualitative approach, analyses of 528 PSTs' blog
   posts, transcriptions of two focus groups with 11 PSTs, and 3 TEs'
   reflections and discussion transcripts yielded four themes that related
   to both the PSTs' and the TEs' perspectives regarding the integration of
   blogs into BL: (1) keeping sequential learning, (2) supporting
   self-directed learning, (3) keeping a sense of a learning community, and
   (4) increasing motivation and critical thinking. Nevertheless, both the
   PSTs and TEs described unique roles for blogging in BL. The TEs
   indicated that blogs support a sense of control, reveal misconceptions,
   and model teaching, while the PSTs indicated that blogs increase or
   decrease self-confidence during BL. The implications pertain to the
   contribution of blogging in BL, as well as to the four pedagogical
   principles of effective BL design: (a) continuity in learning, (b)
   fostering autonomous learning, (c) building a learning community, and
   (d) reflectivity and professional development.

AB Background: Educating undergraduate healthcare students is challenging
   due to the complexity of the healthcare environment today. Healthcare
   education systems focus mainly on discipline specific thinking using
   linear frameworks and reductionist approaches. Education of nurses,
   pharmacists, physicians, social workers, respiratory therapists takes
   place in a siloed environment with minimal interprofessional
   interaction. Yet, organizations expect new graduates to have skills and
   understanding of collaborative care with knowledge of healthcare systems
   thinking, IPP, Team STEPPS (R), methods of group dynamics, and a
   knowledge of Informatics when they enter the workforce.
   Purpose: The purpose of this article is to 1) discuss and describe
   challenges in a high-tech complex healthcare environment that
   necessitate teaching systems thinking to future healthcare students, and
   2) describe the use of interprofessional education (IPE),
   interprofessional practice (IPP), Team STEPPS (R), curricular content,
   and other teaching methods as strategies for teaching systems thinking.
   Conclusion: Systems thinking in healthcare supports a holistic approach
   to care, inclusive of high-tech in the complex environment. With the
   rapid changes it is necessary to modify our teaching theories we use to
   educate new healthcare providers. Educating and practicing the key
   concepts/principles of IPE, IPP, and TeamSTEPPS, and group dynamics,
   along with the important integration of technology, can provide the
   foundation to develop systems thinking and critical thinking in our
   complex healthcare environment.

AB TVET in Malaysia is geared toward providing quality education, training,
   and resources but it still needs to be strengthened and reformed toward
   producing a more quality and skilled workforce. This study aimed to
   procure feedback from TVET curriculum key-players' (automotive) on the
   integration of automotive case-based simulation (CBS) as TVET future
   learning strategies. Collective case-study research design was used with
   purposive sampling design which involved 5 curriculum key-players in
   vocational college and 16 automotive industries as study respondents. A
   set of questionnaires and interview protocols were used to gather
   quantitative and qualitative data. Intra-class correlation coefficient
   (ICC) was used to obtain an average measure agreement among raters.
   ATLAS.ti was also used through thematic analysis to produce models. The
   ICC showed high values of agreement for the process and structure of the
   CBS. The limitation of this research focused on one program (automotive
   technology) through the key-players' and industries' perspectives toward
   the implementation of CBS as a tool to enhance students' soft skills.
   The collation of both data showed the alignment between both parties
   against the CBS. The curriculum key-players agreed that CBS fulfilled
   its requirements as a tool to enrich TVET students' marketability
   skills, supported by the automotive industries' perspective which
   believed that using CBS would prepare TVET students' readiness to the
   workplace. Notably, the CBS provides an opportunity to stimulate
   thinking and learning preferences among students, in addition to being a
   learning tool for future TVET learning strategies that connect theory
   and practice in preparation for job training.

TI Universities without Walls: A Blended Delivery Approach to Training the
   Next Generation of HIV Researchers in Canada

AB (1) Background: Although HIV has not diminished in importance in Canada,
   the field of HIV research remains small, and the graduate students who
   decide to pursue careers within it feel isolated and uncertain about
   their professional skills and opportunities. Universities Without Walls
   (UWW) was created in 2009 to help redress these shortcomings. This paper
   presents a case study of UWW, a non-credit training program for emerging
   HIV researchers in Canada. In particular, we focus on the possibilities
   of experiential learning via online and blended delivery. UWW uses both
   online and in-person teaching modalities to teach engaged scholarship,
   interdisciplinarity, community-based research (CBR), intervention
   research, and ethics. (2) Methods: Using a case study, we elucidated the
   research question: "What are the factors that make Universities Without
   Walls a viable training environment in the contemporary HIV/AIDS field?"
   Focus groups were conducted with 13 UWW key stakeholders in 2012 during
   a program mid-point evaluation; in 2014, telephone or in-person
   interviews with the three directors were conducted by a UWW fellow (the
   4th author of this paper), and in 2019 the authors analyzed the
   information and anecdotal evidence, which had been incorporated as thick
   description. In addition, fellows' self-assessments via portfolio and
   results from formal learning assessments were included. We also
   thematically analyzed 65 student self-reports (2009-2015). (3) Results
   and Discussion: Each UWW cohort lasted 9 months to one year and was
   comprised of: a) sustained mentorship from the co-directors (e.g., phone
   conversations, assistance with grant writing, letters of reference,
   etc.); b) fortnightly online webinars that aim to develop fellows'
   knowledge of community-based research (CBR), research ethics,
   intervention research, and interdisciplinary research; c) community
   service learning in the form of a "field mentoring placement"; d)
   face-to-face engagement with fellows and mentors, most notably at the
   week-long culminating learning institute; e) a stipend for fellows to
   carry out their training activities. The UWW pedagogical framework
   features experiential learning, critical pedagogy, and heutagogy made
   manifest in the field mentoring placements (community service learning),
   mentorship mediated by technologies, and in-person learning institutes.
   Our analysis showed that experiential learning was imparted by UWW's a)
   transparency about its "implicit curriculum", the attitudes, values,
   character, and professional identity imparted in the program as well as
   the overarching programmatic elements, such as commitment to diversity,
   the inclusion of those with lived experience, the flexible admissions
   policies and procedures, interdisciplinary faculty, flexible team,
   administrative structure, and valuing of technology in conducting
   research, learning, and teaching; b) curriculum co-designing and
   co-teaching, and c) sustaining a community of practice. The main results
   reported in our case study included significant "soft outcomes" for UWW
   fellows, such as developing a "social presence" as a precursor to
   lasting professional connections; learning to experience community-based
   research, intersectionality, and interdisciplinarity by interacting
   online with persons living with HIV, leaders in the field, and a variety
   of stakeholders (including nonprofit staff and policymakers).
   (4) Limitations: While fellows' self-evaluation data were collected by
   an independent assessor and anonymized to the extent this was possible,
   the co-authors inevitably bring their preconceptions and positive biases
   to UWW's assessment. As UWW was developed to function outside of
   traditional academic structures, it is unlikely that the UWW program
   could be transferred to a post-secondary environment in its entirety.
   UWW was also built for the socio-political environment of HIV health
   research. (5) Conclusions: The experiences of those involved with UWW
   demonstrate that explicit curricular components-such as
   interdisciplinarity, community-based research, intervention research,
   and applied ethics-can be learned through a blended delivery when
   combined with opportunities to apply the knowledge in ways, such as a
   field mentoring placement and a learning institute. Related to this
   outcome, our case study describes that implicit curricular components in
   the formation of a professional-the sense of self in the field as a
   researcher, student, and community member-can also be delivered through
   a blended model. However, the tools and activities need to be tailored
   to each student for their context, while pushing their disciplinarian
   and professional boundaries.
