 abstract = {University lecturers are usually experts within a specific context domain of knowledge, however they are seldom expert teachers or educational technology wizards. Facilitating professional development for lecturers to engage with innovation in teaching and learning utilizing new technologies is no simple process. However, we have found that structuring lecturer professional development around a sustained community of practice can result in a journey of conceptual and pedagogical transformation [1]. The increasing ubiquity of mobile devices and social media provides a platform for enabling pedagogical change. Thus we established a MOBile Community Of Practice (MOBCOP) of lecturers interested in researching the potential of mobile social media in education interested in exploring the concept of the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum [2], and how mobile learning can be utilized as a catalyst [3] to move towards student-directed heutagogy. We argue that the MOPCOP framework is potentially applicable to a variety of higher education contexts.},

 abstract = {A variety of economic, social, political, and technological factors have come together to create a perfect storm of change in higher education: skyrocketing educational costs, the demand for skill- and competency-based education, the rise of the knowledge economy. People are now lifelong learners, learning their profession throughout life, in chunks and when they need it. Added to that, the explosive advancement of technology in the last decade has made learning readily accessible at any time, everywhere, and in any form. The convergence of these factors has left higher education institutions scrambling and institutional, teacher, and learner roles in a state of flux. Heutagogy, also called self-determined learning, offers a teaching and learning framework for navigating the oncoming storm. The theory draws on established learning theories – humanism, constructivism, andragogy, transformative learning, and complexity theory – and the latest neuroscience to create a composite map for institutional leaders, teachers, and learners alike to apply to professional and lifelong learning. This chapter explores the tenets of heutagogy and how a heutagogical learning approach can be supported using the latest technological developments and be implemented in pedagogically meaningful ways in order to develop learners who are able to excel in today’s complex, global workforce.},

 abstract = {This book aims to provide insight into the complexities confronting higher education today and to highlight tangible opportunities that exist to address such issues. We are in a constant state of flux, and higher education needs to respond in more proactive, intentional, and innovative ways to remain a relevant cornerstone to society and culture. The editors begin by asking how our collective reality might change if the complexity and uncertainty surrounding us were embraced and leveraged to serve the learner and society as a whole. They invite the reader to explore collaborative approaches to individualized learning pathways, networked learning, and a reimagined ecosystem of academia. The chapters are arranged to inform the reader seeking knowledge on how to 1) reshape and redefine the 21st century university, with its evolving role in these transformative times; 2) design and implement courses that address the changing needs of the university and the non-traditional student; and 3) utilize research on innovative strategies with processes that promote organizational learning. The chapters profile the fluid nature of learning as it evolves in higher education and the workplace, often with a blurred line separating the two environments. Exciting ideas related to heutagogy, problem-based learning, innovative constructivist strategies, authentic learning, and self-regulated learning all converge in this volume.},

This means that the approach to teaching and learning in higher education should place the emphasis on students that are autonomous and self-directedApproach. This leads to profound implications for designers of open and distance learning (ODL) study materials as students in this environment usually reside far away from the institution and often feel alienated when starting this learning process. E-learning can change this landscape to become a platform where knowledge can be shared and discussed amongst peers. In this chapter I will, through a case study, give an example of such a process that not only creates a virtual rich environment for active e-learning, but also delivers critical thinking graduates to the workplace.},

 abstract = {For transformation to occur in learning environments and for learners, higher education must first consider how such transformation will occur for the designers and facilitators of learning experiences: the university teachers or educators we call faculty (in the US), instructors, lecturers or professors or, in some instances, university staff. For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development as educational development or faculty development (more historically common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity, social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach, while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning, connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity.We share models of alternative approaches to educator development that take advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as #DigPINS, Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs. We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors’) daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve educator professional development that is more transformative, participatory, and equitable.},

(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (2017). Future of work and skills: Paper presented at the 2nd Meeting of the G20 Employment Working Group 15–17 February 2017 Hamburg, Germany. OECD Publishing, Paris.). These drivers have led to several modifications in work practices. For example, in the future many routine tasks will be automated, resulting in workers having to undertake increasingly complex job roles, with teams in geographically dispersed areas (Barnes, S.‐A. and Brown, A. (2016). Stories of learning and their significance to future pathways and aspirations. British Journal of Guidance and Counselling, 44(2): 233–242. (doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2016.1145194). To allow employees to adapt to change, there is an increase in demand for skills that enable individuals to become flexible. Problem solving, communication, and digital skills are key to succeed in the new world of work, as they can be applied to multiple contexts (Bessen, J. (2015).

European Policy stresses the importance of empowering workers to embrace changes through learning while remaining in employment (European Commission. (2010).

 abstract = {Following the introduction of the Google Cardboard virtual reality (VR) head mounted display (HMD) in 2014, mainstream journalism began exploring the potential of VR to transform news storytelling as an immersive experience (Lalwani, 2015; Somaiya, 2015). However, unlike the transformative impact of social media on journalism and journalism education (Mulrennan, 2017), VR has taken several years for this to filter into the curriculum of journalism higher education. AUT’s journalism programme includes a final semester, capstone, assessment in which students produce a piece of long-form immersive journalism that provides the opportunity to embed VR storytelling as an authentic immersive experience. To address this we created a collaborative curriculum design team in 2019 to design a workshop (Sissons & Cochrane, 2019) to introduce journalism students to the potential of VR to explore and create an immersive journalism experience. We used a design based research methodology (McKenney & Reeves, 2019) to structure the curriculum design process into four phases: initial analysis and exploration, development of a prototype curriculum intervention, evaluation and redesign of the intervention, and dissemination of identified design principles and findings. Meeting weekly the design team brainstormed a workshop that mapped the affordances of mobile XR to a real world project, and created a simple demonstration XR environment (https://seekbeak.com/v/kvPq47DpjAw). We founded the workshop design upon the principles of heutagogy (Blaschke & Hase, 2019), as the principles of heutagogy map closely to the core journalism graduate profile outcomes (Cochrane, Sissons, & Mulrennan, 2017). In this workshop students worked in teams to film and compile an interactive experience based on the University’s Journalism Media Centre, creating an interactive tour using SeekBeak (https://seekbeak.com). Using AUTEC ethics processes we obtained informed consent from the participating students for a feedback survey that will inform the second phase redesign of the curriculum design for 2020. Anonymous post-workshop student feedback survey responses, with a 78% return rate (https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-5SMVCVSJ7/) were very positive. We believe this collaborative curriculum design approach provides a simple model that can be utilised in other higher education discipline contexts. References   Blaschke, L. M., & Hase, S. (2019).

 abstract = {Even experienced mountain climbers underestimate key dangers and make poor decisions in stressful, high-risk situations when climbing, leading to injury and death. My own experience indicates that effective education can play a key role in managing these risks and improving experienced climber’s decision making. Current educational approaches for climbers, however, are generally limited to textbooks and ‘on the mountain’ learning. It is vital, therefore, that new approaches and methods are developed to improve learning.    My own experience and emergent case studies indicate that AR (Augmented), VR (Virtual Reality) and MR (Mixed Reality), have affordances (possibilities offered by the technology) to underpin new forms of learning and therefore have the potential to enhance education for high-risk environments. Emergent use of MR immersive technologies includes classroom learning, firefighting and military training. An initial review of literature has indicated though that there are very limited examples of rigorous research on the design and application of MR technologies in authentic education, especially for extreme situations such as mountaineering i.e., no one has rigorously designed for these technologies for learning in extreme environments, evaluated learning outcomes and theorised about how learning can be enhanced.    In response to this gap/opportunity, this research explores the potential of MR technologies to effectively enhance learning for authentic, high-risk situations. The research will use a Design-based research methodology (DBR) to develop design principles informed by key learning theories as they offer recognised and critical approaches for a new way of learning in an extreme environment.  Underpinned by a Constructivist paradigm, initial theoretical frameworks identified include Authentic Learning and Heutagogy (student-determined learning).Herrington and co-authors (2009) recommended 11 design principles for the incorporation of mobile learning into a higher education learning environment, and Blaschke and Hase (2015)’s 10 principles of designing learning for heutagogy. Other theories and frameworks include Constructivist Learning and the ZPD (the Zone of Proximal Development), design for mobile MR learning and user-centred design. Activity Theory will also be utilised in the data analysis.   Initial design principles will be developed by the DBR methodology. These design principles will be tested through the implementation and evaluation of an MR ‘prototype’ app design solution.’ The prototype solution will be iteratively redesigned using further evaluation and feedback from sample cohorts of end-users. Data will be collected from key participant interviews, researcher observation/reflections and biometric feedback. Methodological triangulation (multimodal data approach) will be used to evaluate learning outcomes. The iterative development will lead to transferable design principles and further theorising that can be transferred to other learning situations involving preparation and decision-making as well as knowledge in high-risk contexts.    Reference   Amiel, T., & Reeves, T.

 abstract = {This paper examined the role of technology in enhancing teaching and learning in Cambodian higher institutions and its implication for stakeholders. Evaluation of ICT models, emerging technologies and the learning theories related to technology were systematically reviewed. An overview of teaching and learning before the digital age with a particular reference to history of education and technology in Cambodia was examined while historical theories of educational technology such as constructivism, complexity theory, the pedagogy of nearness, heutagogy, and connectivism were highlighted. Furthermore, emerging technology integration models such as SAMR, TPACK, UDL models were examined including the multiple roles of the learner, educator and the audience in a connected age.Several strategies in which technological tools that can be used to enhance students’ learning were provided. Part of the Implication of the study includes adequate provision of power supply, computer laboratories and internet connectivity in Cambodian higher institutions should be paramount to government, private firms, philanthropists and NGOs so that students can appreciate technology and learn fast. Aside that, adequate fund should be given to the institutions to procure other necessary technology gadgets that can be used to promote learning.   Keywords: ICT Models, Teaching and Learning, Higher Institutions, Stakeholders, Cambodia},

 abstract = {Watching video online is one of the most performed activities on the internet in Brazil, according to PNAD Continua 2017. To explore the relationship of this activity with education, the aim of this study was to identify ways to use Youtube videos to support the learning process by college students. To try to elucidate this issue, a systematic literature review (RAMOS, FARIA, FARIA, 2014) was conducted on Youtube and education in the CAPES Theses Database  to inquire the accumulation of discussion on the subject. This literature review showed that there are 4 dissertations in this Brazilian database that studied the use of Youtube videos in elementary school. There is a gap in studies in higher education or focusing on informal learning. As an exploratory survey of the theme was applied an online questionnaire to collect data on the use of Youtube to support the learning process. From the content analysis (BARDIN, 2009) of the 64 answers, 4 interest categories were identified in the use of Youtube: 1) content learning, 2) content review, 3) test preparation and 4) audiovisual resources used. In general, it is noted that Youtube videos have been used to answer a specific demand or to reinforce school or self-interest knowledge due to their ease of access and their audiovisual resources. Resumo Assistir vídeo online é uma das atividades mais realizadas na internet no Brasil, segundo dados da PNAD Contínua 2017. Para explorar a relação desta atividade com a educação, o objetivo deste estudo foi identificar formas de utilização de vídeos do Youtube como suporte ao processo de aprendizagem por universitários. Para tentar elucidar esta questão foi realizada uma revisão sistemática da literatura (RAMOS; FARIA; FARIA, 2014) sobre o Youtube e a educação no catálogo de teses e dissertações Capes para averiguar o acúmulo de discussão sobre a temática. Esta revisão da literatura mostrou que há 4 dissertações nesta base brasileira que estudaram a utilização de vídeos do Youtube no ensino fundamental. Há uma lacuna de estudos no ensino superior ou que foquem na aprendizagem informal. Como levantamento exploratório do tema foi aplicado um questionário online para levantar dados sobre a utilização do Youtube como suporte ao processo de aprendizagem. A partir da análise de conteúdo (BARDIN, 2009) das 64 respostas foram identificadas 4 categorias de interesses na utilização do Youtube: 1) aprendizagem de conteúdo, 2) revisão de conteúdo, 3) preparação para testes e 4) recursos audiovisuais utilizados. Em geral, nota-se que vídeos do Youtube têm sido utilizados para atender uma demanda específica ou para reforçar um conhecimento escolar ou de interesse próprio devido a sua facilidade de acesso e aos seus recursos audiovisuais.

 abstract = {The integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the classroom for learning is becoming important to improve student engagement and interaction.  This is in line with the educational transformation towards achieving Higher Education 4.0 in Malaysia. Education 4.0 (Edu 4.0) is in line with the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (4IR) and underpin the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025. There has been a recent surge in published studies on Mobile-Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy), with most studies has been conducted in developed countries, where the outcomes of the studies have revealed that M-Heutagogy has significant impacts on Edu. 4.0. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to discuss the M-Heutagogy pedagogical affordances of such a tool, the challenges that it poses, and the pedagogical change that is entailed for the adoption of the M-Heutagogy in the classroom.  As a preliminary investigation in Malaysia, this study was carried out based on the phenomenological perspective of selected student teachers concerning the above affordances and challenges of M-Heutagogy through interviews. It was revealed that the use of such a novel learning tool helped spur their students’ interest, stimulate their curiosity, and improve their confidence in learning scientific concepts. In particular, the use of M-Huetagogy has proven can help to improve student participation in the learning process through more intense discussions among student teachers, which led to an improved understanding of learning concepts. However, the main barriers to full integration of such a tool in teaching and learning were attributed to the lack of technical support, teaching skills and confidence, and suitable facilities.},

 abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce has become an overriding objective within higher education. New pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and support personalization of learning, are central to this objective. Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology can be a powerful instructional approach for building students’ self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner’s acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in online learning environments, and the use of the e-portfolio in further cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also offers recommendations for future practice and theory.},

 abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This study of affordances in educational technology focuses on how the self-perceptions of teachers influence the creation of educational opportunities and how these are received by learners.

Background: It is important to explore the affordances offered by teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational technology affordances with the two agents—teachers and students—has often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can create opportunities to address their students’ needs, while effectively conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration are utilised.

Methodology: A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation.

Contribution: The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further, teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social involvement from the learner. 

Findings: The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching possibilities for learning interactions.

Recommendations for Practitioners: Teachers are encouraged to vary approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and capabilities to engage in social interactions.

Impact on Society: This study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond the boundary of the classroom. 

Future Research: Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants further investigation.},

 abstract = {With the advent of e-learning, advocates use the term interactivity instead of interaction among students, and between the teacher and the students. Many universities use Moodle for online teaching and learning. This paper explores the perceptions and experiences of students in three Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Mauritius. A mixed-methods approach was used, with an online survey questionnaire administered to 600 students and focus group discussions were conducted with 15 students from these institutions. It was found that 68.4% of respondents used WhatsApp compared to only 23.6% of them who used the e-learning platform, Moodle. There were no associations between the use or frequency of using WhatsApp or Facebook and the types of HEI to which the students belonged. Students preferred WhatsApp due to its facility for knowledge sharing and construction, its interactivity, its usability, respect for privacy and instant communication. From the findings, it is recommended that HEIs bring a shift in their approaches to teaching and learning from cognitivism to socio-constructivism, connectivism and heutagogy.},

Bloom's taxonomy has been used to define taxonomic levels in learning since the 1950's; “create” is one of its highest taxonomic levels. It can be difficult to create relevant, authentic assessments that require students to display both synthesis of meaning, as well creative synthesis of concepts learned to reach this “create” level in an effective manner. Transformative learning and especially heutagogy or “self-determined learning” can be used as theoretical curriculum models or frameworks to help students learn and solve problems.

Educators were also challenged with finding ways to better prepare students for an uncertain future where lifelong learning skills are essential. The current pandemic has only served to intensify the storm, and educational institutions have rushed to technology in order to survive. In response to the new — or next — normal, institutional leaders are attempting to adapt traditional curriculum and systems so that they can transition rapidly to remote teaching and learning. Online, hybrid, and hyflex learning have become the beguiling buzzword solutions of today. How to survive this perfect storm and the storms to come? This presentation will propose that it is not technology that will best address these challenges; instead, a fundamental rethinking of how we teach and learn is necessary. By adopting heutagogy — or a pedagogy of agency, where the learner takes control of learning — will we be able to agilely transition and pivot across delivery methods, while also equipping our students with the lifelong learning skills and competencies required for the future.},

 abstract = {Abstract   With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required students to become more self‐directed in their learning. In addition, teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self‐determined learning. This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing self‐directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a higher education institution that has introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg, difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted, students preferred learning in a self‐determined way.       Practitioner notes  What is already known about this topic?    Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing these skills.   The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online space, requiring more self‐directed learning skills in learners.   Heutagogy has been identified as a net‐centric teaching and learning theory for online learning.    What this paper adds    Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings in order to develop learners' self‐directed and lifelong learning skills.   Explores the pedagogy‐andragogy‐heutagogy continuum and its use as an instructional strategy.   Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has implemented self‐determined learning.    Implications for practice and/or policy    This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for developing self‐directed and lifelong learning skills.   This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce self‐determined learning into classroom settings.      },

 abstract = {Abstract   Can a new instructional approach influence lifelong learning and the development of competent lifelong learners? Blended and online learning provides a platform for learning that introduces technological affordance to enable learning. We seek to find an intersection between blended and online learning and lifelong learning through an instructional approach that encourages learners towards management of their own learning. This opens the door to becoming an autonomous, capable, self‐directed lifelong learner. In this context, heutagogy offers an instructional approach that may connect blended and online learning settings with the development of lifelong learning competence. After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning, literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical experiences exist, to technology‐enabled lifelong learning. Results corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning.       Practitioner notes   What is already known about this topic   Recent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do, including the design and delivery of education.   This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the lifespan.   The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning self‐direction, ‐determination, and ‐regulation, which can be helpful, even essential, for lifelong learning.     What this paper adds   This paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and institutional leadership and infrastructure.   It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to technology‐enabled lifelong learning.   Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development, and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be considered heutagogical.     Implications for practice and/or policy   Develop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster greater self‐directed and lifelong learning.   Educational development to support instructors to understand heutagogy and how it can be applied in the design and delivery of blended and online learning to foster technology enabled lifelong learning.   With the implementation of a heutagogical approach, student orientation along with purposeful scaffolding needs to be implemented to support students as they become more autonomous learners in technology‐enabled settings.      },

 abstract = {This paper examines the implications of the implementation of a policy that promotes open teaching in an emerging open university. It describes the benefits and risks associated with such implementation within the context of Mauritius. It emphasises the adoption of cMOOCs which is more student-generated MOOCs that encourages student engagement based on socio-constructivism and heutagogy, instead of behaviourism and cognitivism. The use of open teaching promotes the democratisation of higher education and may help open universities to achieve economies of scale, and therefore making open universities profitable. However, open teaching through the adoption of cMOOCs may lack sustainability due to the political bearing of the open university concerning its governing bodies and the nomination of its head at the management level, the lack of electracy of a large number of contingent teaching staff as well as the lack of safeguard for the intellectual copyrights of MOOCs in Mauritius. It is recommended that open universities should invest massively in technology-enhanced content delivery and in the appointment of a graphic designer to support user-content generation.

 abstract = {Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in instruction; however, these foundations have not kept pace with technology's evolution. Through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic audiences. Finally, the authors offer an approach for the assessment of these assignments, including a rubric.},

 abstract = {This presentation focuses on a transdisciplinary approach to innovative and collaborative learning practices driven by technology. It highlights two salient elements associated with industry practices and processes in relation to learning and educational contexts: empowerment of individuals and communities of practice through technology, and a broader consideration of industrial approaches to the concept of learning and teaching enhanced within a digital environment. More precisely, this presentation will feature some of the key theoretical frameworks used in three different settings of learning and teaching in France with regards to the life-long learning approach thanks to Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) (WEF, 2016). It will also discuss the positive effect of the Internet and its affordances (Southerton & Taylor, 2020) on reducing the differences between theoretical and applied knowledge via professional-focused communities (Danvers, 2003). Thus, it will briefly explain that spatial and cognitive learning proximities (Lave & Wenger 1991; Fruchter, 2001) can be reduced by virtue of technology (Anders, 2016; Antonczak, 2019; Glazewski & Hmelo-Silver, 2019) and that ‘computer-supported collaborative learning’ methods can facilitate social and shared problem-solving (Sawyer, 2005; Levallet & Chan, 2018; Presicce et al., 2020) without the ‘restriction of time and place’ (Cheng et al., 2019, 489). Additionally, it will point out some aspects of problem-solving through ‘emancipatory learning and social action’ (Merriam, 2001, 9) through the use of ‘actual’ content and ‘actionable feedback’ (Woods & Hennessy, 2019) enhanced by digital tools and tactics. Next, it will focus on three case studies by concisely presenting key specifics for each of the courses, including the various digital tools used and followed by some quick interim reflections. Then it will summarise the challenges and the barriers encountered across the different practices such as virtual delivery, the size of the students' groups and some connectivity considerations. It will be followed by the principal advantages and opportunities, like the professionalisation dimension through interactive and authentic learning enhanced by affordances. And it will conclude with some managerial recommendations as experiential and practical methods (knowledge codification) thanks to industry-based teaching supported by digital technologies. The presentation will close with the overall conclusion in relation to digital technology and some of the key 21st-century career skills. In general, the findings will be of interest to academics, practitioners and policymakers. The added value of this transdisciplinary investigation is that it improves research on collaborative innovation and collective knowledge by creating a bridge between the fields of Education and Business.   Bibliography Anders, A.

 abstract = {Learning continuity in the realm of Education 4.0 is posing a stiff challenge to educators due to the physical restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic on institutional learning. Around 320 million learners were prevented from going to schools/colleges across India causing a sudden joltin all educational activities. Despite the challenges, higher education institutions responded affirmatively and evolved to harness the advantages of assistive technologies to ensure the continuity of teaching–learning activities, research, and thus service to the society. The paper discusses the evolution of the blended learning paradigm and its efficacy to ensure higher learning specifically at the tertiary level. In the quest to identify a suitable instructional mechanism, academic institutions have pursued a variety of techniques including synchronous, asynchronous, or mixed-mode heutagogic learning approaches. The researchers seek to use a thematic literature review of the various relevant learning models to explain the nuances of blended learning attributed to the factors of commitment, flexibility, collaboration, and self-paced managed learning environments. The paper proposes a narrative of andragogic styles that are universal and acceptable for higher education institutions to practice and avoid disruption to education.},

 abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This study of affordances in educational technology focuses on how the self-perceptions of teachers influence the creation of educational opportunities and how these are received by learners.

Background: It is important to explore the affordances offered by teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational technology affordances with the two agents—teachers and students—has often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can create opportunities to address their students’ needs, while effectively conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration are utilised.

Methodology: A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation.

Contribution: The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further, teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social involvement from the learner. 
Findings	The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching possibilities for learning interactions.

Recommendations for Practitioners: Teachers are encouraged to vary approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and capabilities to engage in social interactions.

Impact on Society: This study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond the boundary of the classroom. 

Future Research: Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants further investigation.},

 abstract = {Our research question focuses on how industry-based practices enable learning experiences between a wide range of collaborators and in a variety of spatiotemporal surroundings, including educational contexts, supported by the latest technological evolutions. We start with the observation that the advent of the digital transformation of our society bridges the gap between industry and academia and provides many opportunities for the future by expanding learning experiences. This change has been undeniable since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, the success of apprenticeship training (Cerdin and Peretti in The success of apprenticeships, 2020; Montargot and Drillon in Succ Apprentice Views Stakeholders Train Learn 3:79–86, 2020) shows a growing interest in blended learning (Dziuban et al. in  Int J Educ Technol High Educ 15:1–16, 2018) and ‘mixed processes and practices’ (Parsons and MacCallum in Agile and lean concepts for teaching and learning. Springer, 2019) on the part of companies and universities. Based upon three lecturers’ experiences in France, this chapter provides practical insights about how to align industry-based practices and higher education by focusing on three specific methods/approaches: ‘learning-by-doing’ through workshops, ‘project-based learning’ by means of case studies, and ‘heutagogy’ via mixed modes. Our aim is to highlight key challenges and barriers, advantages and opportunities of these three different approaches, and to suggest recommendations to support further development of innovative digital teaching and learning practices in higher education.},

 abstract = {This chapter draws upon the experiences of building an authentic collaboration between a University team of academics and students with a hospital design lab and healthcare practitioners to solve real world problems that the hospital stakeholders were ill-equipped to tackle. The collaboration was founded through establishing a like-minded community of practice built upon mutual trust, and the formation of a transdisciplinary design team. The STUDIO602 project demonstrated the mutual benefits of authentic collaboration between industry and higher education. Universities have expertise in supervising and mentoring student research teams to solve real-world problems. By building authentic collaboration between university research teams and hospital design teams innovative solutions to practical health care problems can be solved. Such collaborative design partnerships will lead to better health outcomes for society as innovative solutions to pre-hospital care, out-patient care, and innovative design of hospital infrastructure and technology-enhanced practices are developed. Extending these collaborations to international teams working remotely together we can widen the impact of the developments beyond New Zealand, and bring into the design team international expertise as well. We discuss the application of several techniques used in the software industry and how they relate to the STUDIO602 project—these include design thinking, team management, stakeholder engagement and rapid prototyping techniques. The innovation we are illustrating in this chapter through this project example are the development of pedagogical design principles to facilitate authentic collaboration between student design teams and industry.},

 abstract = {Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is established by UNESCO and ILO as education and training beneficial for the community. The community will be able to develop when they can use their leadership skill properly. This is what makes adult vocational education very important in building the nation. One example of the role of adult vocational education is reducing unemployment through a heutagogy approach. The heutagogy approach centered on individual participants, where the individual has full autonomy in creating their learning. The heutagogy approach is also helpful for developing an individual's self-capacity and vocational self-concept. The individual vocational self-concept through the heutagogy approach can help students, graduates, alumni, and the community develop skills (re-skills, up-skills) and prepare to enter the world of work. The skill development can be done by forming (re-establishing) the individual's vocational self-concept. In the development of the industrial revolution 4.0 and society 5.0, the role of self-concept with a heutagogy approach in advanced adult education is to build vocational self-concepts so that they can be independent in learning, prepare work skills and utilize technology well as lifelong learning, and make an individual as a digital transformation society. Besides that, the heutagogy approach has a triple-loop learning process that aims to make the right decision on the learning power of vocational self-concept. With the preparation of work skills, the self-concept of vocational maturity means that the higher the self-concept, the higher the maturity in the industrial era 4.0 career and Society 5.0 or with the existence of vocational self-concept in the future can make mature decisions.},

 abstract = {Industry 4.0 advancements in technology are creating a dynamic and fast changing world that affects how we live and work. Educators need to rethink existing teaching approaches to better prepare learners for future careers that Industry 4.0 will create. The World Economic Forum defined a new education model, called Education 4.0, which contains eight major changes to redefine learning in the new economy. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is an approach that promotes critical thinking, social-emotional skills, and life-long learning. These skills are necessary for Education 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to recommend the principles of heutagogy as an effective teaching and learning approach to meet the needs of Education 4.0. The approach of the study examines existing literature on Education 4.0 and heutagogy. A conceptual model that interconnects heutagogy to the four learning principles of Education 4.0 will be offered as a key finding to answer the research question: How does heutagogy in higher online education meet the needs of Education 4.0? The paper provides a base for further research and discussion into how heutagogy and other approaches can support the needs of Education 4.0 to prepare learners for a changing world.

The aim of the article is to analyze the experience of using innovative technologies in higher pedagogical education in the European Union countries. Methods of analysis and synthesis, prediction, comparison, and abstraction were used to realize this main task. The results traced the main innovative technologies popular in European pedagogical universities. The effectiveness of interactive learning, modular education system, technology of level differentiation, methods of learning through research (use of the project method), E-learning, and deep use of digital platforms, which contributes to the formation of theoretical and practical knowledge, development of critical thinking and creative potential in higher education applicants is demonstrated. It is pointed out that e-learning based on university platforms allows users to actively participate in various international educational projects, creatively interact with other users and even create new content. Several European universities (from France, Germany, Austria, and other countries) have merged their e-learning platforms into one professional global service called web2.0. Important directions for the further development of teacher education will be heutagogy, peeragogy, or paragogy and cybergogy. The conclusions stressed the importance of further integration of digital innovative methods to teaching pedagogical disciplines.},

 abstract = {Nearly all educational institutions use learning management systems (LMS). Post-pandemic figures suggest that the uptake of LMS is about 98%. This means that most educators, especially those in post-schooling education, will use, and be responsible for designing, an online course site. While there is a tendency to use course sites as a repository and convenient communication medium, there is an unmet need to design these sites in a way that facilitates learning. As online teaching and learning become more prolific, especially in higher education and adult learning contexts, it is increasingly necessary to design course sites that facilitate learning as opposed to course sites that are just repositories. Just like the approaches that a teacher uses in classroom teaching, the teacher's underpinning philosophy will impact the way they will design their course sites on an LMS or website. Despite technology and online being present for over two decades, course design and teaching in the online environment remains trapped in traditional behaviorist and content-driven approaches.},

Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics’ positioning through a typology of epistemic views.},

 abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice. We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this offers opportunities for ‘teachable moments’ (Newell et al, 2023) and gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them, and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence.},

Thus, the student satisfaction is an essential element of higher education that can support student achievement. This study aims to describe the satisfaction of Political Science students with the heutagogy approach in education at the Universidad de Manila, Philippines using a descriptive quantitative approach with a survey method. The subjects of this study were the twenty-nine (29) students of the Political Science education program at Universidad de Manila, Philippines who are currently enrolled in Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Political Data (PSC222). The sampling used was purposeful which is a non-probability. The result reveals that the students were very satisfied (62.1%) with the quality of teaching, satisfied (58.6%) with the course content, satisfied (37.9%) with the campus facilities, and very satisfied (55.2%) with the student support and services. The results disclosed that student satisfaction is a vital aspect in higher education as it affects their motivation and academic success, especially in this era of Globalization, Technology, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), is increasing, which forces the world of education to have positive innovations for the advancement of education.},

 abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which emphasize the use of technology, self-determined learning, and collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the participation of 124 Mexican students of technical-professional education. The study’s objective was to analyze how they scaled their communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico. Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic thinking (z = –2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly higher mean (M = 25.36) than men (M = 25.11). Qualitative results support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital literacy.},

Thus, the evaluation of research productivity has become relevant due to the emerging development of the PAH continuum as a theoretical framework. This paper aims to explore the research productivity within the PAH continuum by performing a bibliometric performance analysis. An iterative search strategy was performed to identify PAH authors and then investigate their research productivity over a 5-year period (2017–2022) using the SciVal analytics instrument by Elsevier. Drawing upon the results from multiple bibliometric analyses, the study explores publication productivity specifically in relation to the PAH continuum. This study revealed that distance education, learning, teaching, professional development, and lifelong learning have been the most prominent research areas within the PAH continuum. Within that, related topics were identified, including online learning, mobile learning, e-learning, and educational technology.},

It purviews the integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features that support technology-enhanced language learning experiences. Principles of pedagogy, heutagogy, and self-determination theory are used to inform the appropriate design and application of AI to support language learning. We examine the congruence between learner's goals with perceived outcomes following a 4-week language learning intervention using an app. A survey of n = 151 adult learners across two Canadian universities revealed: (a) apps are perceived as an engaging, convenient, and structured approach to early stages of L2 learning and (b) the integration of AI for conversation-based simulations or speech recognition would enable more adaptive, personalized L2 learning experiences. The authors discuss implications for future developments and AI uptake for language learning apps.},

 abstract = {The increasing shift from learning solely face-to-face towards various forms of online and blended or hybrid styles of educational interaction between faculty and students has been a feature of higher education over the past three decades. With improved internet access for individuals and small organisations, this shift has become even more pronounced and recognised as a major opportunity to provide a more equal geographical and social access to learning opportunities. The restrictions to travel and the gathering of large groups during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a major paradigm change for many institutions to adopt online course delivery. This has also necessitated a significant change in thinking about how online educational interaction is designed and delivered, and in many cases, the pedagogical change is running behind the changes in technology that facilitate improved distributed communications. The University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland has been a significant early adopter of online education. This chapter attempts to summarise some of the key lessons learned in the design and implementation of learning and teaching strategies that encourage and support students to utilise online resources to enhance their own education. This chapter proposes a design structure and method of engagement based upon heutagogy (self-directed learning) that incorporates diverse digital learning resources to enable optimal flexibility for online learners.},

A notable area for improvement is observed in the availability of a comprehensive framework to direct the formulation of Open and Distance Learning (ODL) environments that aptly cater to the requisites of adult learners. There needs to be a comprehensive framework to guide the design of ODL environments that meet the needs of adult learners and which is supported by adult learning theories, online knowledge construction, and technology acceptance. This paper examines the instructional designs intended to improve adult learner achievement and meet the self-empowerment needs of adult working students.

 abstract = {Students in higher education are using mobile devices, which challenges our understanding of what it means to learn in modern environments. By using mobile devices as instructional aids, students gain a variety of social, cognitive, and technical abilities. Mobile devices may therefore be seen as supporting the growth of employability skills and broader lifelong learning, both of which may be helpful in a variety of circumstances. The quickly evolving landscape of technology and education presented teachers with a number of challenges, and they had to retrain and refresh their skills in order to provide practical training. As a result, heutagogical methods are ideal for enhancing their collective knowledge and skills. Online and blended learning (BL) offer a learning environment that incorporates technological affordances to facilitate learning. This enables the growth of an independent, capable, and self-directed lifelong learner. Heutagogy provides an educational strategy in this context that may link the development of lifelong learning competencies with BL and online learning environments. Using this methodology, we investigate the potential contribution of online and blended higher education to technology-enabled lifelong learning where heutagogical experiences are available. The results support the notion that heutagogy and lifelong learning are linked by some basic concepts that apply to both mixed and online learning environments.},

Objective: To ascertain the function of technology integration in augmenting digital literacy proficiency and to explore the mediating influence of heutagogy in elucidating the correlation between technology integration and digital literacy. Methods: A quantitative method was utilized to examine data from student responders in the "Islamic Religious Education" curriculum at five campuses in Yogyakarta. Data was gathered using internet surveys. The PLS-SEM model was employed to examine direct and mediated effects, as well as multigroup analysis to investigate any discrepancies in test outcomes. Findings: The inclusion of technology does not immediately influence students' digital literacy. Heutagogy effectively facilitates the impact of technology integration on enhancing digital literacy. The incorporation of technology intended to improve digital literacy among final-year students exhibits a detrimental effect, which can be mitigated through heutagogical intervention. Conclusion: The findings corroborate prior research emphasizing the significance of policy context, culture, and student demographics as determinants affecting the efficacy of technology integration in enhancing digital literacy.   Keywords: digital literacy, heutagogy, higher education, learning, islamic religious education, technology integration.

 abstract = {<p>The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) presents unprecedented opportunities and challenges for higher education. This forces higher education to confront a critical question: How can this transformative technology reshape learning without diminishing the unique strengths of human cognition? This paper examines how modern AI like GAI can be effectively integrated within a heutagogical framework to enhance teaching, learning, and assessment while developing human intelligence and agency. Drawing on recent research in AI capabilities and limitations, we analyse the distinctions between artificial and human intelligence, emphasising how AI's computational strengths can complement human cognition's emotional and ethical dimensions. We propose an AI-augmented heutagogical design framework aligned with increasing levels of learner autonomy and complexity. This framework demonstrates how AI can facilitate personalized learning pathways while developing both crystallized and fluid intelligence. The paper argues that successful integration of AI in higher education requires intentional pedagogical shifts, faculty development, and infrastructure investments. By foregrounding heutagogy in the modern AI landscape, institutions can create learning environments that promote intrinsic motivation, self-determined learning, and the development of critical 21st-century competencies. This approach positions higher education to evolve beyond building human capital toward fostering comprehensive human development in an AI-augmented world.</p>},

Авторы предлагают собственный кейс решения проблемы цифровой трансформации педагогических компетенций в условиях новых потребностей поколений и «иной дидактике», а также роста нагрузки на преподавателей вузов. Цель статьи — апробировать технологию развития цифровых педагогических компе- тенций преподавателей вузов (на примере кейса УрФУ). Теоретическая база исследования представлена широким охватом концепций (от теорий классиков до конструктивизма, сме- шанного обучения, и хьютагогики), подкрепленных ссылками на соответствующие источники. Проведенный анализ позволил обосновать необходимость смены технологии преподавания и роли преподавателя как носителя цифровых и педагогических компетенций и партнера, обладающего социально- значимыми для нового контингента качествами. Практическая значимость заключается в предложенной методике обучения преподавателя высшей школы по актуальной дидактической модели. Методика встроена в технологию разви- тия цифровых педагогических компетенций. По мнению авторов, данная технология должна основываться на таких этапах, как фиксация текущего уровня освоения педагогической те- ории и практики по широте и глубине, а также фактической потребности по направлениям цифровых педагогических компетенций; разработка и утверждение программы ДПО исходя из полученных в ходе эмпирического исследования результатов; оценка результатов обучения у целевой аудитории до и после прохождения обучения. Эмпирическую часть исследования представляют результаты замера цифровых и педагоги- ческих компетенций молодых преподавателей через интервью и анкетирование. Результаты первой части эмпирического исследования легли в основу, разработанной методом обратного дизайна, программы повышения квалификации «Профессиональное мастерство преподавателя университета: современные подходы и практики». Цель которой — интеграция предметных знаний с цифровыми и дидактическими инструментами через использование инновационных методов обучения. Сравнительный анализ данных входного и итогового опросов выявил значи- тельный прогресс в развитии цифровых педагогических компетенций слушателей программы. Статья вносит вклад в вопросы методологии и практики в области новой «цифровой дидак- тики» в динамично развивающихся информационно-образовательных средах. The relevance of the topic stems from the shifting role of higher education instructors in the context of a digital society. The authors present their own case study addressing the challenge of digitally transforming pedagogical competencies to meet the evolving needs of new generations, adapt to «alternative didactics,» and manage the increasing workload on university educators. The article aims 108 ВЕСТНИК Сургутского государственного педагогического университета № 2 (95) 2025 г. to test a technology for developing digital pedagogical competencies among university teachers, using the case of Ural Federal University (UrFU). The theoretical framework of the study integrates a broad range of concepts, from classical theories to constructivism, blended learning, and heutagogy, supported by references to relevant sources. The analysis substantiates the necessity of redefining teaching methodologies and the instructor’s role as both a bearer of digital and pedagogical competencies and a collaborative partner equipped with socially relevant qualities for contemporary student cohorts. The practical significance lies in the proposed methodology for training higher education teachers based on a modern didactic model. This methodology is embedded within a technology for developing digital pedagogical competencies, which the authors argue should involve three key stages: (1) assessing the current level of mastery of pedagogical theory and practice (breadth and depth) and identifying gaps in digital pedagogical competencies; (2) designing and approving a continuing professional education (CPE) program informed by empirical research findings; and (3) evaluating learning outcomes among the target audience before and after training. The empirical component includes results from measuring digital and pedagogical competencies of early-career teachers through interviews and surveys. Findings from the initial empirical phase informed the development of a professional development program, Professional Mastery of University Teachers: Modern Approaches and Practices, designed using backward design. The program aims to integrate subject-specific knowledge with digital and didactic tools through innovative teaching methods. Comparative analysis of pre— and post-training surveys revealed significant progress in trainees’ digital pedagogical competencies. The article contributes to the methodology and practice of «digital didactics» within rapidly evolving information-educational environments.},

Drawing on historical context and integrating theoretical frameworks including constructivism, andragogy, heutagogy, and critical perspectives on power in competency definition, the analysis reveals both transformative potential and significant limitations of CBE models. Evidence from successful implementations (Western Governors University, Southern New Hampshire University) and discontinued programs (Queensborough Community College) demonstrates varied outcomes across student populations, challenging monolithic claims about CBE effectiveness. The research reveals critical tensions: subscription pricing models benefit rapid completers while potentially disadvantaging slower-paced learners; prior learning assessment processes may reproduce existing inequities without intentional intervention; and micro credentials show differential labor market value across fields and demographic groups. The brief concludes that successful CBE implementation requires robust support infrastructures, purposeful technology integration, transparent assessment frameworks, sustainable financial models, attention to faculty implications, and embedded equity considerations—recognizing that these models represent particular educational values that exist alongside other legitimate approaches to higher education.},

 abstract = {(Trendsetter Presentation)   Higher education (HE) has existed and functioned in its defined boundaries, practices, policies and procedures for centuries. This has served the HE institutes well, providing certainty, control, power and legitimacy. While emerging technologies have posed some challenges, higher education institutions have managed to stand their ground without having to change. The pandemic in 2019 forced HE institutions to become agile with their ingrained practices and rules, to explore uncharted avenues to facilitate education. For the first time in modern education, we witnessed a vast scale of unprecedented changes to how we interact with learners and how we facilitate learning and teaching. For once, the learners were seen as partners in the learning process. We trusted our students and let go of some of the control as borders shut, and we pivoted to online education. We redesigned our assessments to integrate relevance and authenticity, even providing autonomy to the learners to co-create the assessments with us. Mobile phones and social media tools played a critical role in bridging the student and academic world, the learning with teaching as they existed in different spaces. With learning eventuating away from the scheduled classes and highly structured ecosystems, learners gained ownership over their learning path and processes—the beginnings of self-regulated and determined learning.   As life, however, began to normalise, HE institutions started rolling back the changes and progress made during the pandemic. Where online learning was once seen as the equivalent of the premier face-to-face teaching, it now stands as a legacy of the pandemic, dethroned and marginalised. The lessons learnt were forgone in favour of on-campus learning until the rise of ChatGPT in late 2022. HE institutions again faced a seismic threat to the integrity of their processes and learning and teaching in general. Unlike the pandemic, ChatGPT has been on a relentless march over the last three years, inspiring many diverse offspring capable of imitating human-like language, writing and creative capabilities collectively known as generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI). Perhaps, the pandemic was an early warning of things to come, and the lessons during this period were critical to understanding and implementing strategies for effective integration of Gen AI in education. The pandemic created uncertainty when certainty was known, whereas Gen AI has created uncertainty when certainty is unclear. Against this backdrop, we will engage in a conversation related to the bigger issues in education, as we feel Gen AI has brought us to a juncture where critical distinctions need to be made or understood. For example, education and learning. Are they synonymous, or is there a difference? Does the distinction matter and why? Why is it relevant to the current Gen AI climate and the future of learning (or education)? We will draw upon the principles of heutagogy and their parallels to the pandemic pedagogy. We will revisit the role social media tools played, along with smartphones during this time and their alignment to heutagogy. We will dare to stargaze on mobile and personalised instances on Gen AI and their implicationson education. We conclude that the future of education in the Gen AI realm is on learner-centred, regulated and determined principles. Principles that are built on partnership, trust, criticality, kindness, hope, and authenticity, which help enable learner voice in their journey of learning to become and be.},

 abstract = {This study was initiated to address the limited bibliometric analyses on heutagogy, despite its growing prominence in higher education as a learner-centered, self-determined approach. As the field gains momentum, understanding its research landscape is essential for guiding future pedagogical practices and scholarship. We conducted a bibliometric review of 290 publications from 2005 to 2024 indexed in the Scopus database, applying PRISMA guidelines and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer was used to analyze citation networks, co-authorship patterns, and keyword co-occurrences. Findings show a significant increase in publications, peaking in 2020, with Blaschke identified as the most cited author and Cochrane as the most prolific. Auckland University led institutional contributions. The research spans disciplines such as education, computer science, and business, with thematic focuses on educational technology, lifelong learning, and 21st-century skills. However, collaboration remains largely regional, indicating opportunities for broader international engagement. The review highlights heutagogy's growing impact on flexible and technology-enhanced learning environments. These insights have practical implications for curriculum development, instructional design, and educational policy. Conclusively, heutagogy is poised to play a transformative role in higher education, particularly in promoting autonomy, adaptability, and lifelong learning. Future research should expand global collaboration heutagogical practices.},

 abstract = {This study aimed to develop and evaluate Augmented Reality (AR)-based learning media to enhance students’ cognitive abilities at State Vocational High School (SMK Negeri) 2 Pati, particularly in the subject of Computer Networking and the Internet. The research was motivated by low student achievement in meeting the Minimum Mastery Criteria (KKTP), which was primarily attributed to the continued reliance on traditional teaching methods and low student motivation. A research and development (R&D) approach was employed using the ADDIE model. The resulting AR media is an Android application that integrates text, audio, images, animations, interactive 3D objects, and simulations, and is in accordance with the Merdeka Curriculum. Expert evaluations showed a very high level of feasibility, with ratings of 94% from a subject matter expert and 91% from a media expert. These results were further supported by Aiken’s V index, which indicated very high validity for the material (0.921) and high validity for the media (0.881). A practicality test was conducted, revealing a high level of effectiveness, with a 94% approval rating from both teachers and students. Moreover, a pretest–posttest control group design demonstrated significant progress in learning outcomes. The experimental group achieved an average post-test score of 83.75, significantly higher than the control group’s 73.60. Based on the N-Gain test, the experimental group achieved an average gain of 65.52% (moderately effective), whereas the control group achieved only 38.75% (ineffective). This study contributes to the theories of learning transfer, connectivism, and heutagogy, and offers practical implications for vocational education in adopting innovative technologies.   },
