   abstract = {(1) Background: Although HIV has not diminished in importance in Canada, the field of HIV research remains small, and the graduate students who decide to pursue careers within it feel isolated and uncertain about their professional skills and opportunities. Universities Without Walls (UWW) was created in 2009 to help redress these shortcomings. This paper presents a case study of UWW, a non-credit training program for emerging HIV researchers in Canada. In particular, we focus on the possibilities of experiential learning via online and blended delivery. UWW uses both online and in-person teaching modalities to teach engaged scholarship, interdisciplinarity, community-based research (CBR), intervention research, and ethics. (2) Methods: Using a case study, we elucidated the research question: "What are the factors that make Universities Without Walls a viable training environment in the contemporary HIV/AIDS field?" Focus groups were conducted with 13 UWW key stakeholders in 2012 during a program mid-point evaluation; in 2014, telephone or in-person interviews with the three directors were conducted by a UWW fellow (the 4th author of this paper), and in 2019 the authors analyzed the information and anecdotal evidence, which had been incorporated as thick description. In addition, fellows' self-assessments via portfolio and results from formal learning assessments were included. We also thematically analyzed 65 student self-reports (2009-2015). (3) Results and Discussion: Each UWW cohort lasted 9 months to one year and was comprised of: a) sustained mentorship from the co-directors (e.g., phone conversations, assistance with grant writing, letters of reference, etc.); b) fortnightly online webinars that aim to develop fellows' knowledge of community-based research (CBR), research ethics, intervention research, and interdisciplinary research; c) community service learning in the form of a "field mentoring placement"; d) face-to-face engagement with fellows and mentors, most notably at the week-long culminating learning institute; e) a stipend for fellows to carry out their training activities. The UWW pedagogical framework features experiential learning, critical pedagogy, and heutagogy made manifest in the field mentoring placements (community service learning), mentorship mediated by technologies, and in-person learning institutes. Our analysis showed that experiential learning was imparted by UWW's a) transparency about its "implicit curriculum", the attitudes, values, character, and professional identity imparted in the program as well as the overarching programmatic elements, such as commitment to diversity, the inclusion of those with lived experience, the flexible admissions policies and procedures, interdisciplinary faculty, flexible team, administrative structure, and valuing of technology in conducting research, learning, and teaching; b) curriculum co-designing and co-teaching, and c) sustaining a community of practice. The main results reported in our case study included significant "soft outcomes" for UWW fellows, such as developing a "social presence" as a precursor to lasting professional connections; learning to experience community-based research, intersectionality, and interdisciplinarity by interacting online with persons living with HIV, leaders in the field, and a variety of stakeholders (including nonprofit staff and policymakers).(4) Limitations: While fellows' self-evaluation data were collected by an independent assessor and anonymized to the extent this was possible, the co-authors inevitably bring their preconceptions and positive biases to UWW's assessment. As UWW was developed to function outside of traditional academic structures, it is unlikely that the UWW program could be transferred to a post-secondary environment in its entirety. UWW was also built for the socio-political environment of HIV health research. (5) Conclusions: The experiences of those involved with UWW demonstrate that explicit curricular components-such as interdisciplinarity, community-based research, intervention research, and applied ethics-can be learned through a blended delivery when combined with opportunities to apply the knowledge in ways, such as a field mentoring placement and a learning institute. Related to this outcome, our case study describes that implicit curricular components in the formation of a professional-the sense of self in the field as a researcher, student, and community member-can also be delivered through a blended model. However, the tools and activities need to be tailored to each student for their context, while pushing their disciplinarian and professional boundaries.},

This study aimed to procure feedback from TVET curriculum key-players' (automotive) on the integration of automotive case-based simulation (CBS) as TVET future learning strategies. Collective case-study research design was used with purposive sampling design which involved 5 curriculum key-players in vocational college and 16 automotive industries as study respondents. A set of questionnaires and interview protocols were used to gather quantitative and qualitative data. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to obtain an average measure agreement among raters. ATLAS.ti was also used through thematic analysis to produce models. The ICC showed high values of agreement for the process and structure of the CBS. The limitation of this research focused on one program (automotive technology) through the key-players' and industries' perspectives toward the implementation of CBS as a tool to enhance students' soft skills. The collation of both data showed the alignment between both parties against the CBS. The curriculum key-players agreed that CBS fulfilled its requirements as a tool to enrich TVET students' marketability skills, supported by the automotive industries' perspective which believed that using CBS would prepare TVET students' readiness to the workplace. Notably, the CBS provides an opportunity to stimulate thinking and learning preferences among students, in addition to being a learning tool for future TVET learning strategies that connect theory and practice in preparation for job training.},

   abstract = {Background: Educating undergraduate healthcare students is challenging due to the complexity of the healthcare environment today. Healthcare education systems focus mainly on discipline specific thinking using linear frameworks and reductionist approaches. Education of nurses, pharmacists, physicians, social workers, respiratory therapists takes place in a siloed environment with minimal interprofessional interaction. Yet, organizations expect new graduates to have skills and understanding of collaborative care with knowledge of healthcare systems thinking, IPP, Team STEPPS (R), methods of group dynamics, and a knowledge of Informatics when they enter the workforce.Purpose: The purpose of this article is to 1) discuss and describe challenges in a high-tech complex healthcare environment that necessitate teaching systems thinking to future healthcare students, and 2) describe the use of interprofessional education (IPE), interprofessional practice (IPP), Team STEPPS (R), curricular content, and other teaching methods as strategies for teaching systems thinking.Conclusion: Systems thinking in healthcare supports a holistic approach to care, inclusive of high-tech in the complex environment. With the rapid changes it is necessary to modify our teaching theories we use to educate new healthcare providers. Educating and practicing the key concepts/principles of IPE, IPP, and TeamSTEPPS, and group dynamics, along with the important integration of technology, can provide the foundation to develop systems thinking and critical thinking in our complex healthcare environment.},

As reflective blogs were found to be supportive of pre-service student teachers' (PSTs') as well as teacher educators' (TEs') professional development, the current study aimed to explore PSTs' and TEs' perceptions regarding the potential of integrating blogs into the BL modality. Applying a qualitative approach, analyses of 528 PSTs' blog posts, transcriptions of two focus groups with 11 PSTs, and 3 TEs' reflections and discussion transcripts yielded four themes that related to both the PSTs' and the TEs' perspectives regarding the integration of blogs into BL: (1) keeping sequential learning, (2) supporting self-directed learning, (3) keeping a sense of a learning community, and (4) increasing motivation and critical thinking. Nevertheless, both the PSTs and TEs described unique roles for blogging in BL. The TEs indicated that blogs support a sense of control, reveal misconceptions, and model teaching, while the PSTs indicated that blogs increase or decrease self-confidence during BL. The implications pertain to the contribution of blogging in BL, as well as to the four pedagogical principles of effective BL design: (a) continuity in learning, (b) fostering autonomous learning, (c) building a learning community, and (d) reflectivity and professional development.},

   abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which emphasize the use of technology, self -determined learning, and collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the participation of 124 Mexican students of technical -professional education. The study's objective was to analyze how they scaled their communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico. Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic thinking (z = -2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly higher mean ( M = 25.36) than men ( M = 25.11). Qualitative results support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital literacy.},

This article uses the researcher's six critical success factors identified across the 35 mlearning projects to evaluate these three projects, and concludes that projects resulting in ''no significant difference'' in pedagogical outcomes are the result of attempts to shoehorn old pedagogies into new technologies.

   abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study of affordances in educational technology focuses on how the selfperceptions of teachers influence the creation of educational opportunities and how these are received by learners.Background It is important to explore the affordances offered by teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational technology affordances with the two agents-teachers and students-has often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can create opportunities to address their students' needs, while effectively conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration are utilised.Methodology A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation.Contribution The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further, teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social involvement from the learner.Findings The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching possibilities for learning interactions.Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers are encouraged to vary approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and capabilities to engage in social interactions.Impact on SocietyThis study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond the boundary of the classroom.Future Research Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants further investigation.},

   abstract = {For transformation to occur in learning environments and for learners, higher education must first consider how such transformation will occur for the designers and facilitators of learning experiences: the university teachers or educators we call faculty (in the US), instructors, lecturers or professors or, in some instances, university staff. For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development as educational development or faculty development (more historically common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity, social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach, while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning, connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity.We share models of alternative approaches to educator development that take advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as #DigPINS, Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs. We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors') daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve educator professional development that is more transformative, participatory, and equitable.},

However, understanding the factors influencing student acceptance of these technologies remains challenging. This study examines how Heutagogical and Cybergogical Behaviors affect vocational high school students' intentions to use AR and VR in classrooms, with Virtual Experience as a mediator. By extending the UTAUT2 model, the research offers insights into technology adoption in vocational education. Conducted in July 2024 with 438 students from six Indonesian regencies, the study used a quantitative, non-experimental design. PLS-SEM analysis revealed that Heutagogical and Cybergogical activities significantly influenced students' performance and effort expectancy, increasing their intention to use AR and VR. Virtual Experience fully mediated the effects of performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, social influence, and price value on students' intentions. However, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions directly impacted behavioral intentions, underscoring the importance of ease of use and support in adopting these technologies. The findings suggest that integrating structured and self-directed learning approaches, providing immersive hands-on opportunities with AR/VR tools, and ensuring ease of use and strong institutional support can enhance technology adoption. These strategies align vocational training with industry demands, preparing students for technologically driven workplaces.},

   abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice. We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this offers opportunities for 'teachable moments' (Newell et al, 2023) and gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy come first.

   abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics' positioning through a typology of epistemic views.},

   abstract = {Can a new instructional approach influence lifelong learning and the development of competent lifelong learners? Blended and online learning provides a platform for learning that introduces technological affordance to enable learning. We seek to find an intersection between blended and online learning and lifelong learning through an instructional approach that encourages learners towards management of their own learning. This opens the door to becoming an autonomous, capable, self-directed lifelong learner. In this context, heutagogy offers an instructional approach that may connect blended and online learning settings with the development of lifelong learning competence. After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning, literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical experiences exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Results corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicRecent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do, including the design and delivery of education.This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the lifespan.The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning self-direction, -determination, and -regulation, which can be helpful, even essential, for lifelong learning.What this paper addsThis paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and institutional leadership and infrastructure.It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning.Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development, and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be considered heutagogical.Implications for practice and/or policyDevelop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster greater self-directed and lifelong learning.Educational development to support instructors to understand heutagogy and how it can be applied in the design and delivery of blended and online learning to foster technology enabled lifelong learning.With the implementation of a heutagogical approach, student orientation along with purposeful scaffolding needs to be implemented to support students as they become more autonomous learners in technology-enabled settings.},

They are the cornerstone on which the stability and growth of the education system, including technical and vocational education. In the current situation, the teaching-learning process shall be decided based on the requirements of the learner at every level. With fast changing technology and education norm, educators faced many challenges and took various way in upgrading and reskilling themselves towards providing practical teaching session. Therefore, heutagogical approaches are appropriate for improving skill and knowledge among them. This study is aimed to determine the efforts level of educator in 13 different Vocational colleges in Johor. A total of 141 educators participated in the survey questionnaire that measures their efforts toward six heutagogical elements in teaching and learning. The finding shows that majority of the educators shows the high level of efforts toward improving their skills and knowledge. The educator's perception on the implementation of heutagogy in teaching and learning process benefit tremendously in designing practical and sustainable professional development course for educators. Also contributes to heutagogy model in technical and vocational education settings.},

   abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce has become an overriding objective within higher education. New pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and support personalization of learning, are central to this objective. Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology can be a powerful instructional approach for building students' self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner's acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in online learning environments, and the use of the eportfolio in further cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also offers recommendations for future practice and theory.},

Through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic audiences. Finally, the authors offer an approach for the assessment of these assignments, including a rubric.},

   abstract = {Mobile Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy) is the teaching practice that emphasizes self-determined learning and student autonomy. Many teachers and academicians have applied M-Heutagogy in their teaching and learning in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The purpose of this study is to synthesize an empirical literature review of the M-Heutagogical practice among Higher Education students and its acceptance. The main objective of this paper is to review the literature on M-Heutagogy practice and its acceptance among Higher Education students. The researcher conducted a systematic review of 60 articles for the period 2007 to 2020. The findings indicate that M-Heutagogy has been applied in HEIs around the world with the support of emergent technologies and mobile applications. Unfortunately, only two M-Heutagogy acceptance studies have been done so far. Future research suggested that the M-Heutagogy acceptance model should be developed to be referred by researchers while doing an acceptance study.},

   abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition, teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning. This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a higher education institution that has introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg, difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted, students preferred learning in a self-determined way.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic?Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing these skills.The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners.Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning theory for online learning.What this paper addsPositions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning skills.Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an instructional strategy.Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has implemented self-determined learning.Implications for practice and/or policyThis study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills.This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce self-determined learning into classroom settings.},
